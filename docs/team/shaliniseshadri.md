### Project: GameBook

GameBook is a desktop app designed for you to track your gambling performance and view instant analysis of
your gambling records.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Modifications to existing features**:<br>
  Refactoring Storage component of AB3<br>
  Adding Tests for GameBook's Storage Class.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:<br> 
  Bug fixes in existing features 


* **New Features**:<br>
Implementing Graphical Analysis of game entries:
   - Used JavaFX LineChart to plot the average profit across dates on the GraphPanel
  and integrate them into the GUI.<br>
     The graph feature provides users with a visualisation of their average profits 
     across the last 20 dates. This supports our user story of being able to view analysis of their game statistics
     and evaluate their performance while doing so. <br> 
     By implementing this feature, I gained a better understanding about using JavaFX LineChart and how it can be used to 
     visualise data efficiently using various data structures to process this data. It also provided me with an opportunity to understand the different UI components and their interactions 
     through JavaFX better. <br>
     
  Implementing Statistical Analysis of game entries:
    - Implemented the classes which calculate the Mean and Median and integrate them into the GUI <br> 
      The calculation of mean and median of the overall profits of the users provides users with analysis of their 
      overall average profits. The statistics are re-calculated and updated after every command and displayed on the GUI.
      This supports our user story of being able to view game statistics to evaluate their performance.<br> 
      By implementing this feature, I gained a better understanding into the internal workings of the app to facilitate the efficient 
      calculation of the statistics. Implementing this feature also supplemented my understanding of the Graphical Analysis 
      feature which helped in further improving the Graphical Analysis feature.
